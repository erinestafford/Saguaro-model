The saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea), a keystone species in the Sonoran Desert, has faced population decline in recent years. The immediate threat to the saguaro cactus is the increase in wildfires fueled by the invasive species buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare). The increasing rate of wildfires could result in the collapse of the Sonoran Desert ecosystem. A stage structured model is used to capture interactions between saguaro cacti (juvenile and adults), their nurse trees, and buffelgrass. The introduction of buffelgrass to the model demonstrates its influence on the natural life cycles of the saguaro and nurse tree populations. This model consists of a system of non--linear ordinary differential equations which considers commensalism between juvenile saguaros, their nurse trees, and the eventual competition between adults and nurse trees. Both qualitative analysis of the equilibria of the system as well as a numerical analysis of the sensitivity of key parameters are done. In the interest of preserving the saguaro cactus population, this model will provide insight into the effectiveness of current mitigation strategies.
